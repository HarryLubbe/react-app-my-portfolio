                                    I used React, a javascript library for building user interfaces, to build my website. Alongside that i utilised the Material-UI API for my components giving it a sleek, proffesional feel. In my homepage I utilised the react particle-api-js lirbrary to incorporate particle effects and finally hosted my website on Azure hosting as well as built an Azure-Doc-Pipeline.
